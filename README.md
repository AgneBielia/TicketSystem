# TicketSystem

Database systems design and manipulation (SQL, Python) First-Year Computing Science project

Prototype backend for a customer support ticket system. 

The database contains a ticket system to track customer support issues. The ticket system
works by customers logging support questions which are stored in the database. Staff members respond to
these questions and log an update to the ticket. When the question has been suitably answered and no
further response has been received from the customer, the ticket is closed.
